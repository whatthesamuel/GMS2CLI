 First things first, I added a 'CLI_' prefix to every asset included with this extension.
I know that this isn't exactly a 'command line interface', but I think it won't be bothering anyone too much,
and it will make things easy to tell which is which.

 You probably don't have to mess with the 'CLI_Scripts' scripts. Instead, look into the 'CLI_COMMANDS' script.
I've made some examples on how to add your custom commands that should be sufficient to understand
how this all works. Also see 'CLI_obj_draw' object to see how it is all applied in actual use.

 If you have any questions or feedback, leave it in the comment section(depending on where you got it), or send
me an email at alex01763@gmail.com

 Happy coding!
